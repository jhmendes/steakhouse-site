## Project Summary

Round two, here we go.  Over the last 6-12 months I have been stuck in tutorial land.  I've consumed alot of online courses and have learned a ton.  Looking back, one of the most beneficial experiences was taking a mockup from online and building it from scratch.  Recently, I visited dribbble.com again and picked out a wide variety of mockups.  This will be the start of a new series for me as I build mockups from scratch.

My focus will be on code quality, structure, and layout. 

Google + Coffee + Music = Success.

Whatever it takes!
